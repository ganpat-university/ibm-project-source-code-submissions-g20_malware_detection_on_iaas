# Overview

With the advent of Cloud computing being espoused very briskly by organizations with diverse businesses and sizes, the utilization of cloud services is soaring at an untrackable rate these days more importantly IaaS services as cloud providers allow more secured resources with supple offerings and models. This escalating adoption gives birth to new surface attacks to organizations that attackers tend to abuse with their malware to dominate these invaluable resources and the important data that is stored on them. Therefore, for organizations in order to well guard against these malware attacks they need to have full discernibility not only on their data centers but also on their resources which are stored on the cloud. 


This proposed project discusses and aims to yield the best approaches to attain continuous monitoring of malware attacks on the cloud along with their phases (before, during, and after). This project line ups to defines the best methods to bring loggings and forensics to the cloud platform and integrate them with on-premises visibility, thus attaining the full monitoring over the whole security standpoint of the organization assets whether they are on-premises or on the cloud.
